# internationalizer

<p>I have developed a managing application for diffrent languages within all of your applications.</p>

<p>If the application dont fit to your database feel free to fork it and change it to fit your needs.</p>





<h2>Usage Instruction</h2>

1. Create a application
2. Create a term and add as many languages as you want
3. Add a term to an application and give it a variable
4. Call in your application the term with the given variable



<h2>How to implement the variable - term translation in your application?</h2>
Just look how it's been done in the internationalizer application :D
